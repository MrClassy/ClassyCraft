Development Guide:

Styles:
	We use tabs for indentation, this allows users to set their own spacing.
	Curly Brackets hold unique lines.  
		function()
		{
			//code
		}
	
	All methods and classes must be unit testable.
		Unit tests are not required on all code, however the code must be able to be tested.
	We apply DRY
		Keep code as simple as possible, it makes reusing it easy.
	Use verbose naming where posible (Comments for organization are ok)
	
	
Features:
	New features should follow a similar pattern as other features.
		Improvements on the pattern are always welcome,  but refactoring is useful.
	
	New features must be scalable!
		If a feature relies on a player or on an event ensure that the feature can scale up to 100+ players.
		Unit testing will be used to mock high levels of players to identify issues at high usage.
	Please update the Suite map in this directory as features are added or proposed.
